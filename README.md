# School District Analysis
## Project Overview
In the school district analysis, we analyzed school performance based on standardized test scores and tried to pinpoint the factors that lead to higher test performance. We used two CSV files containing the student data and school data, along with the pandas module in python, to discern each school's attributes. We then used those attributes to create performance indicators that the school board can use to address struggling schools and allocate resources to improve testing performance. After our initial analysis, we were notified that the test scores for 9th-grade students attending Thomas High School were compromised. We adjusted our analysis to reflect the new information and to ensure an accurate analysis of the school district in question. By manipulating CSV data in data frames, we will determine vital metrics, such as how school size affects standardized test scores.
